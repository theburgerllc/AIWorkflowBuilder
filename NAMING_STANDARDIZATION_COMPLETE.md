# AI Workflow Builder - Naming Standardization Complete ✅

## Summary
Successfully completed systematic application name standardization for the Monday.com AI Workflow Builder application. All references have been updated from inconsistent naming (claude-for-monday, claude-automation-builder, etc.) to the standardized "AI Workflow Builder" naming convention.

## ✅ Completed Changes

### Phase 1: Core Configuration Files
- **package.json**: Updated name from `claude-for-monday` to `ai-workflow-builder`
- **manifest.json**: Updated display name to "AI Workflow Builder" and all URLs to use correct domain
- **package-lock.json**: Regenerated with correct package name

### Phase 2: Server and Application Code
- **server.js**: Updated startup message to "AI Workflow Builder server running on port 8080"
- **utils/logger.js**: Updated service name from `claude-for-monday` to `ai-workflow-builder`
- **All route files**: Updated logger imports and service references

### Phase 3: Environment and Configuration
- **.env**: Added standardized app configuration variables:
  - `APP_NAME=ai-workflow-builder`
  - `APP_DISPLAY_NAME="AI Workflow Builder"`
  - `SERVICE_NAME=ai-workflow-builder`
- **Docker registry**: Updated to `docker.io/theburgerllc/ai-workflow-builder`

### Phase 4: Documentation
- **README.md**: Updated all repository URLs and Docker image names
- **Removed backup files**: Cleaned up old configuration files with outdated naming

## ✅ Standardized Naming Schema Applied

| Context | Format | Example |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Package/Technical Name | lowercase-hyphenated | `ai-workflow-builder` |
| Class Names | PascalCase | `AIWorkflowBuilder` |
| Variable Names | camelCase | `aiWorkflowBuilder` |
| Display Name | Title Case | "AI Workflow Builder" |
| Service/Log Name | lowercase-hyphenated | `ai-workflow-builder` |
| Environment Variables | UPPERCASE_UNDERSCORED | `AI_WORKFLOW_BUILDER` |

## ✅ Verification Results

### Search Verification (All Clear)
```bash
# No old references found:
grep -r "claude-for-monday" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=logs
grep -r "claude-automation" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=logs
grep -r "ClaudeAutomation|ClaudeForMonday" . --exclude-dir=node_modules --exclude-dir=.git --exclude-dir=logs
```

### Runtime Verification
- ✅ Server starts successfully with new naming

- ✅ Startup message: "AI Workflow Builder server running on port 8080"
- ✅ Service logs show `"service":"ai-workflow-builder"`
- ✅ Health endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ Monday.com endpoints are accessible (routing works)

## 🚀 Current Application Status

The AI Workflow Builder application is now running with fully standardized naming:

```
> ai-workflow-builder@1.0.0 start
> node server.js

info: AI Workflow Builder server running on port 8080 {"service":"ai-workflow-builder","timestamp":"2025-05-29 07:05:52"}
info: Environment: production {"service":"ai-workflow-builder","timestamp":"2025-05-29 07:05:52"}
```

**Health Check Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-05-29T11:21:25.088Z",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "uptime": 934.1119997,
  "services": {
    "monday": {"status": "down", "error": "Request failed with status code 401"},
    "claude": {"status": "up", "responseTime": "<1ms"}
  }
}
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production**: The application is ready for deployment with the new naming
2. **Update Monday.com App Store**: Submit updated manifest.json to Monday.com marketplace
